### Flask vs FastAPI – Key Differences

#### Performance & Speed
* **FastAPI** is significantly faster due to ASGI and async support.
* **Flask** is WSGI-based and synchronous, making it slower for I/O-heavy apps.

#### Built-in Features
* **FastAPI** has automatic data validation, serialization, and OpenAPI docs generation.
* **Flask** is lightweight and minimal—requires manual setup or extensions for most features.

#### Ease of Learning
* **Flask** is beginner-friendly, simple syntax, great for learning basic web APIs.
* **FastAPI** has a steeper learning curve due to typing, decorators, and async nature.

#### API Documentation
* **FastAPI** automatically generates Swagger UI and ReDoc docs at `/docs` and `/redoc`.
* **Flask** has no built-in docs; you need Flask-RESTful, Flask-APISpec, or Swagger extensions.

#### Request Handling
* **FastAPI** natively supports asynchronous (`async def`) route handlers.
* **Flask** uses synchronous functions by default; async is possible but not officially recommended.

#### Type Checking & Validation
* **FastAPI** uses Python type hints and Pydantic models for request/response validation.
* **Flask** needs manual validation or third-party libraries (e.g., Marshmallow).

#### Use Cases
* **Flask** is great for small-to-medium applications, MVPs, or beginners.
* **FastAPI** is ideal for high-performance apps, modern APIs, and ML/data applications.

#### Community & Ecosystem
* **Flask** has a large, mature community with many extensions and tutorials.
* **FastAPI** is newer but growing fast, especially in the data science and microservice space.
